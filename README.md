Busara Technical Task â€“ Data Analysis &amp; Intervention Evaluation
This project was completed as part of an internship technical task for Busara. The objective was to analyze patient continuation rates for a daily HIV preventive pill (DP) distributed in Kenya, identify behavioral patterns affecting adherence, and propose an evidence-based intervention. The analysis includes:

Summary statistics of DP refill data

Visualizations of continuation rates across multiple months

Disaggregation of refill behavior by key demographics (e.g., gender)

A proposed behavioral intervention to improve DP adherence

A critical evaluation of causal inference and intervention assessment

The repository includes:

A Python script with clean, well-commented code (.ipynb or .py)

A PowerPoint presentation of insights and recommendations

This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, behavioral reasoning, and impact evaluation.
